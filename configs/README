README for configs

This directory will hold configuration files for various aspects of the
nypm-nycbug-associates collaboration, e.g., Vagrantfiles.

The names of config files stored here should be specific and self-documenting.
For example, do not store a file named simply "Vagrantfile", as we are likely
to generate many Vagrantfiles in the course of our work.  Instead, store it
with a name that maps it to a specific installation, e.g.,
Vagrantfile.perlmongers-nycbug-generic-freebsd11.
